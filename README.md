# Non-Recursive AVL Binary Search Tree

A simple project to further understand the properties of a self-balancing binary tree.
Instead of using recursion like most implementations, under the restriction of the nodes not carrying any data about its parents and children several vectors are used, using "pointer-like" indexes to organize the information.
